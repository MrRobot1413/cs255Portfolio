Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project involved designing a comprehensive system for a company looking to offer online and on-the-road driver training services. The client, DriverPass, led by Liam and supported by Ian, wanted a system that facilitated training scheduling, online classes, and practice tests with functionalities tailored for different user roles.

What did you do particularly well?
I excelled in thoroughly understanding and documenting the client's requirements, translating these into a detailed project plan with a clear timeline for development and delivery.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Given the opportunity for revision, the requirement gathering phase could be improved by streamlining the process to reduce the time taken without losing the detail and accuracy of information collected.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by closely listening to the client's vision and translating it into technical requirements, ensuring the system was user-friendly, secure, and met the business objectives.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The approach to designing software involved employing diagrams and planning tools to analyze and design the system, ensuring a clear blueprint for development. In future projects, incorporating user feedback early and often through prototypes and iterative development would enhance alignment with user needs and business goals.
